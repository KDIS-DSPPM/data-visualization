# Proposals 

* Use large font size (minimum 12). I don't care what font you use as long as the proposal is comfortable and pleasant to read.

## Proposal guidelines (1 page)

1. Define the project's objective (e.g., what is your research question? Is it descriptive, inferential, predictive, or a mix of them?) 
2. Describe the data sources (e.g., administrative, survey, experimental, digital trace, or a mix of them?)
3. Describe the data collection and wrangling process (recall that the real-world data is messy!) 
4. Describe the specific analyses you will conduct (recall that the data doesn't speak for itself!)
