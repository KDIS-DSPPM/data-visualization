## Setup

- Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r}
ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") >= 1,
  "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", update.packages("dplyr")
)

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # the tidyverse framework
  here, # computational reproducibility
  gapminder, # toy data
  ggthemes, # additional themes
  ggrepel, # arranging ggplots
  patchwork, # arranging ggplots
  broom # tidying model outputs
)
```
