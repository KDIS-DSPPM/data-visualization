# Getting started in R 

## The Big Picture 

When you are reading this section, please note that you've already grasped some key concepts behind R programming language (functions and objects). 

UNIX Commands (`cat`) = R Functions (`print`) 
Files = R Objects 

## RStudio 

There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or using script files (plain text files containing your code).

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting, or sent from the script editor using `Ctrl-Enter`; `Command-Enter` will also work on Macs), R will try to execute it, and when ready, show the results and come back with a new `>`-prompt to wait for further commands. This is the equivalent of the `$` in your terminal. 

## Basic Syntax

**Comments**

Use `#` signs to comment. Comment liberally in your R scripts. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R. For those of you familiar with other languages, there is no doc string, or equivalent to `""``` in R.

**Assignment operator**

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, `x` value is `3`. The arrow can be read as 3 **goes into** `x`.  You can also use `=` for assignments. 

```{r}
USweird <- "Why use lb for pound!" # Use this

"Why use lb for pound!" = USweird
```

Nonetheless, *can* does not mean you *should*. It is good practice to use `<-` for assignments. `=` should only be used to specify the values of arguments of functions. This is what Google and Hadley Wickham recommend as well. If they don't convince you enough, here's [a real example](https://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/assignment-operators-in-r-vs/).

```{r}

mean(x = 1:10) # Does it save x?
rm(x)

mean(x <- 1:10) # Does it save x?
rm(x)

```

**Printing**

In R, an object's contents can be printed by simply executing the object name or calling the ```print()``` function.

**Help**

* `?` + object opens a help page for that specific object
* `??` + object searches help pages containing the name of the object

```{r, eval = FALSE}

?mean
??mean
help(mean)

# The above three will do the same. 

example(ls) # provides an example(s) for how to use ls 

help.search("visualization") # search functions and packages that have "visualization" in their descriptions

```

## Environment 

Environment = a collection of pairs 

### Objects 

- List objects in your current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Create a numeric object 
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# List the object 
ls()

# Remove the object 
rm(x)

```

- Remove objects from your current environment

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

# Create an object 
x <- 5

# Remove the object 
rm(x)

```

- Remove all objects from your current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Create an object 
a <- 7

b <- 3

# Remove the object 
rm(list = ls())

```

- Force memory release 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Garbage collect; for more information, type ?gc() 

gc()

```

### Packages 

`install.packages(package-name)` will download a package from one of the CRAN mirrors, assuming that a binary is available for your operating system. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# From CRAN
install.packages("dplyr") 

# Load package 
library(dplyr)

# From GitHub 
devtools::install_GitHub("jaeyk/tidytweetjson") # my own package 

# Unload package 
# detach("package:stats", unload=TRUE)

```

**Tips**

If you have multiple packages to install, then please consider using the `pacman` package. The following is an example. First, you install `pacman`. Then, you load several libraries by using `p_load()` method.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  ggplot2,
  dplyr, 
  broom
)
```

If you don't like to use `pacman,` the other option is to create a list (we're going to learn what is list soon).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgs <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "broom")

install.packages(pkgs)
```
  
Still, we have to write two lines. The more straightforward, the better, right? Here's another approach that can simplify the code further.

Note that `lapply()` applies (there's a family of apply functions) a function to a list. In this case, library to pkgs. `apply` is an advanced concept related to anonymous functions. We will learn about it later when we study functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

inst <- lapply(pkgs, library, 
               character.only = TRUE)
  
```

## The Big Picture 

**Computational reproducibility**

* Replication = code + data 

* Computational reproduciblity = code + data + environment + distribution 

* Reproducibility checklist by [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/)

    1. Start with science (avoid vague questions and concepts)
    
    2. Don't do things by hand (not only about automation but also documentation)
    
    3. Don't point and click (same problem)
    
    4. Teach a computer (automation also solves documentation to some extent)
    
    5. Use some version control 
    
    6. Don't save output (instead, keep the input and code)
    
    7. Set your seed 
    
    8. Think about the entire pipeline 

## Setup

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # tidyverse
  here # computational reproducibility
)
```

## Motivation 

Why do you need to make your research computationally reproducible?: for your self-interest and public benefits.

### How to organize files in a project 

You won't be able to reproduce your project unless it is efficiently organized. 

Step 1. [**Environment**](https://environments.rstudio.com/) is part of your project. If someone can't reproduce your environment, they won't be able to run your code.

- Launch R Studio. Tools > Global Options. You **should not** check Restore .RData into workspace at startup. Also, set the saving workspace option to **NEVER.**

Step 2. For each project, create a project directory named after the project. 

name_of_the_project 

- data: 
  - raw 
  - processed (all processed, cleaned, and tided)
- figures 
- packrat (optional) 
- reports (PDF, HTML, TEX, etc.,) 
- results (model outcomes, etc.,)
- scripts (i.e., functions)
- .gitignore (for Git)
- name_of_project.Rproj (for R)
- README.md (for Git) 


```{r eval = FALSE}

# Don't name it a project. Instead, use a more informative name. For instance, `us_election`, not `my_project.`

dir.create("../us_election")

```

Step 3. Launch R Studio. Choose File > New project > Browse existing directories > Create project. This allows each project has its workspace. 

Step 4. Organize files by putting them in separate subdirectories and sensibly naming them.

- Treat raw data as read-only (raw data should be RAW!) and put it in the `data` subdirectory.

    - Again, note that version control does not need to replace backup. You still need to back up your raw data. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "data"))

```

- Separate read-only data from processed data and put in the `processed_data` subdirectory.

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "processed_data"))

```

- Put your code in the `src` subdirectory. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "src"))

```

- Put generated outputs (e.g., tables, figures) in the `outputs` subdirectory and treat them as disposable.

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "outputs"))

```

- Put your custom functions in the `functions` subdirectory. Then, you can gather some of these functions and distribute them as an open-source library. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "functions"))

```

Are you tired of creating these directories one by one? Why not automate? See the following example. You can save this function as a rscript (e.g., `setup.r`) and run it in the terminal using `Rscript <script name>.`

```{r eval = FALSE}

if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")

# Load here
pacman::p_load(
  purrr, # functional programming
  here # computational reproducibility
)

# Custom function
create_dirs <- function(name) {
  dir.create(here(name))
}

# Apply function 
purrr::map(c("data", "processed_data", "src", "outputs", "functions"), create_dirs)

```

**Challenge**

Set a project structure for a project named "starwars." 

### How to organize code in an R markdown file 

- In addition to environment, **workflow** is an essential component of project efficiency and reproducibility. 

- What is R markdown? An R package, developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/), provides an authoring framework for data science. Xie is also a developer of many widely popular R packages such as `knitr,` [`xaringan`](https://GitHub.com/yihui/xaringan) (cool kids use xaringan not [Beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) these days), `blogdown` (used to create [my personal website](https://jaeyk.GitHub.io/)), and `bookdown` (used to create this book) among many others.

  - Many applications: [reports](https://rstudio.GitHub.io/distill/basics.html), [presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), [websites](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html)  
  - Check out [Communicating with R markdown workshop](https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/) by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) (RStudio)
    - Alison Hill is a co-author of [`blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 
  - Key strengths: dynamic reporting + reproducible science + easy deployment

```

- R Markdown basic syntax 

```{r}
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

- Use these section headers to indicate workflow.

```{r}
# Import packages and data
# Tidy data
# Wrangle data
# Model data
# Visualize data
```

Press `ctrl + shift + o`. You can see a document outline based on these headers. This is a nice feature for finding the code you need to focus on. 

If your project's scale is large, divide these sections into files and numbers and save them in the `code` subdirectory. 

   - 01_wrangling.Rmd
   - 02_modeling.Rmd 
   ... 

### Making a project computationally reproducible

- `setwd()`: set a working directory. 

- Note that using `setwd()` is not a reproducible way to set up your project. For instance, none will be able to run the following code except me.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Set a working directory 
setwd("/home/jae/starwars")

# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()
ggsave("./outputs/example.png") # This is called relative path 

```

- Instead, learn how to use `here()`'.

   - Key idea: separate workflow (e.g., workspace information) from products (code and data). For more information, please read Jenny Bryan's excellent piece on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).

   - Example 

```{r eval = FALSE}

# New: Reproducible 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

ggsave(here("project", "outputs", "example.png"))

```

   - How `here` works 

   `here()` function shows what's the top-level project directory. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

here::here()

```
   - Build a path including subdirectories 

```{r eval = FALSE}

here::here("project", "outputs")
           #depth 1   #depth 2
```
   - How `here` defines the top-level project directory. For example, the following list came from [the here package vignette](https://GitHub.com/jennybc/here_here)).

      - Is a file named .here present?
      - Is this an RStudio Project? (**Note that we already set up an RStudio Project!** So, if you use RStudio's project feature, then you are ready to use `here`.)
      - Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file?
      - Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named `remake.yml`?
      - Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named `.projectile`?
      - Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named `.git` or `.svn`? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported.

      - If there's no match then use `set_here()` to create an empty `.here` file. 

**Challenge**

1. Can you define computational reproducibility? 
2. Can you explain why sharing code and data is not enough for computational reproducibility
