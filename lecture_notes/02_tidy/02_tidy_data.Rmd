## Objectives

-   Learning the tidy data framework
-   Learning the basic usage of the `ggplot2` package
-   Practicing creating some basic plots using `ggplot2`

## Setup

-   Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r}
ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") >= 1, # Condition 
  "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", # TRUE
  update.packages("dplyr") # FALSE
)
```

```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # the tidyverse framework
  here, # computational reproducibility
  gapminder, # toy data
  ggthemes, # additional themes
  ggrepel, # arranging ggplots
  patchwork, # arranging ggplots
  broom, # tidying model outputs
  gtsummary,
  ggfortify
)
```

## Base R approach 

```{r}
# Scatter plot

## Multiple years
plot(gapminder$lifeExp)
## One year 
plot(subset(gapminder, year == 1997)$lifeExp)
```

```{r}
# Histogram 
hist(gapminder$year)
```

- Not very intuitive 
- Not very analytic approach 

## Tidyverse

### The Big Picture

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1.  Variables -\> **Columns**
2.  Observations -\> **Rows**
3.  Values -\> **Cells**

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

If dataframes are tidy, it's easy to transform, visualize, model, and program them using tidyverse packages (a whole workflow).

![Tidyverse: an opinionated collection of R packages](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/0*mlPyX0NE0WQwEzpS.png)

-   Nevertheless, don't be **religious**.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations are essential (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)). These computations are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames (for more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)).

This is what tidy data looks like.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table1 %>%
```

**Additional tips**

There are so many different ways of looking at data in R. Can you discuss the pros and cons of each approach? Which one do you prefer and why?

-   `str(table1)`

-   `glimpse(table1)`: similar to `str()` cleaner output

-   `skim(table1)`: `str()` + `summary()` + more

**Group practice**

* 1. Form a group of 2. So, basically, find your partner. From now on, we will do pair programming a lot.

* 2. Solve the following problems together. 

```{r}
# 1. How many continents and countries are in the dataset?

# 2. How many years are observed in the dataset?

# 3. Identify grouping variables. For instance, if there's a school, a grouping variable is a class because students are nested in a class.
```

## Visualizing (ggplot2)

-   The following material is adapted from Kieran Healy's excellent book (2019) on [data visualization](https://socviz.co/) and Hadley Wickham's equally excellent book on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/). For more theoretical discussions, I recommend you to read [The Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F0-387-28695-0) by Leland Wilkinson.

### The grammar of graphics

-   the grammar of graphics

    -   data
    -   aesthetic attributes (color, shape, size)
    -   geometric objects (points, lines, bars)
    -   stats (summary stats)
    -   scales (map values in the data space)
    -   coord (data coordinates)
    -   facet (facetting specifications)

No worries about new terms. We're going to learn them by actually plotting.

-   Workflow:

    1.  Tidy data (what data) : `ggplot(data = )`
    2.  Mapping (what relationships) : `aes(x = ,  y= )`
    3.  Geom (how) : `geom_()` 
    4.  Cooordinates and scales (how to see)
    5.  Labels and guides (how to guide) : `labs(),` `guides()`
    6.  Themes (how to theme)
    7.  Save files

### mapping and geom

-   `aes` (aesthetic mappings or aesthetics) tells which variables (x, y) in your data should be represented by which visual elements (color, shape, size) in the plot.

-   `geom_` tells the type of plot you are going to use

### basic aes (x , y)

```{r}
gapminder
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)
) # ggplot or R in general takes positional arguments too. So, you don't need to name data, mapping each time you use ggplot2.

p

p + geom_point()
```

```{r}
p + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() # geom_smooth has calculated a smoothed line;
# the shaded area is the standard error for the line
```

**Question**

* What do you think about the figure above? Think about the x- and y-scale.

### Univariate distribution

- Types of univariate plots (Nolan and Stoudt 2021: 72): 

    - Quantitative: rug plot, histogram, density curve, box-and-whisker plot, violin plot, normal quantile plot
    - Qualitative: bar plot, dot chart, line plot, pie chart

-   `geom_histogram()`: For the probability distribution of a continuous variable. Bins divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals (see [the Wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)).
-   `geom_density()`: Also for the probability distribution of a continuous variable. It calculates a [kernel density estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) of the underlying distribution.

#### Histogram

```{r}
data(midwest) # load midwest dataset

midwest
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) +
  geom_point() # Not working. Why not working?
```

```{r}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) +
  geom_histogram() # stat_bin argument picks up 30 bins (or "bucket") by default. = statistical transformation 
```

```{r}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) # only 10 bins.
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = subset(midwest, state %in% c("OH", "IN")),
  mapping = aes(x = percollege, fill = state)
) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() 
```

- Another example that demonstrates why careful experimentation with the bin could be helpful.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() # once again, the default is 30

ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50)
```

#### Density

```{r}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area, fill = state, color = state)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

### Bivariate distributions

- Types of bivariate plots (Nolan and Stoudt 2021: 72): 

    - Both quantitative: scatter plot, smooth curve, contour plot, heat map
    - Both qualitative: side-by-side bar plots, mosaic plot, overlaid lines
    - Quantitative/Qualitative: overlaid density curves, side-by-side box-and-whisker plots, overlaid smooth curves, quantile-quantile plot

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, 
            aes(x = gdpPercap, 
                y = lifeExp))

# Scatter plot 
p + geom_point()
```

Smoothing helps to clarify the trend(s).

```{r}
# Adding a smoothed line 

p + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

p + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# rug plot
p + geom_point() +
  geom_rug()
```

If observations are too few: consider using scatter plots without a smoothed line. 

Discrete comparison 

```{r}
# Bar plot
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(avg_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(continent, avg_life_exp), y = avg_life_exp)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() 
```

Temporal trends

```{r}
# Line plot using a summary
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_life_exp)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
# individual comparison 
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, 
             col = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
# overall trend
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, 
             fill = country)) +
  geom_area()
```

**Group discussion**

* 1. Form a group of 4-5.
* 2. Of the three figures that describe temporal trends, discuss which figure you prefer for what argument for 15 minutes. 
* 3. Present your ideas for a maximum of 3 minutes.

#### Advanced aes (size, color)

-   There's also `fill` argument (mostly used in `geom_bar()`). Color `aes` affects the appearance of lines and points, fill is for the filled areas of bars, polygons, and in some cases, the interior of a smoother's standard error ribbon.

-   The property size/color/fill represents...

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    size = pop
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    size = pop,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
# try red instead of "red"
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    size = pop,
    color = "red"
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

Aesthetics also can be mapped per Geom.

```{r}
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + # alpha controls transparency
  geom_smooth(color = "red", se = FALSE, size = 2)

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + # alpha controls transparency
  geom_smooth(color = "red", se = FALSE, size = 2, method = "lm")
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  )

ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

#### Coordinates and scales

```{r}
# checking the data distribution is important to evaluate a model 

lm.out <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder)

autoplot(lm.out)

p + geom_point() +
  coord_flip() # coord_type
```

The data is heavily bunched up against the left side.

```{r}

p + geom_point() # without scaling

p + geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() # scales the axis of a plot to a log 10 basis

p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_log10()
```

#### Labels and guides

`scales` package has some useful premade formatting functions. You can either load scales or just grab the function you need from the library using `scales::`

```{r}

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  )
```

6.  Themes

```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_economist()
```

### ggsave

```{r eval = FALSE}
figure_example <- p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_economist()

dir.create(here("outputs"))
ggsave(here("outputs", "figure_example.png"))
```
