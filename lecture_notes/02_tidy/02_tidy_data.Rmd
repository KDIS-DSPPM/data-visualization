# Tidy data and the grammar of graphics

## Objectives

-   Learning the tidydata framework
-   Learning the basic usage of the `ggplot2` package
-   Practicing creating some basic plots using `ggplot2`

## Setup

-   Check your `dplyr` package is up-to-date by typing `packageVersion("dplyr")`. If the current installed version is less than 1.0, then update by typing `update.packages("dplyr")`. You may need to restart R to make it work.

```{r}
ifelse(packageVersion("dplyr") >= 1,
  "The installed version of dplyr package is greater than or equal to 1.0.0", update.packages("dplyr")
)

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # the tidyverse framework
  here, # computational reproducibility
  gapminder, # toy data
  ggthemes, # additional themes
  ggrepel, # arranging ggplots
  patchwork, # arranging ggplots
  broom # tidying model outputs
)
```

## Base R approach 

```{r}
# univariate plot
plot(gapminder$lifeExp)

plot(subset(gapminder, year == 1997)$lifeExp)
```

```{r}
# bivariate plot
plot(gapminder$year, gapminder$lifeExp)
```

## Tidyverse

### The Big Picture

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1.  Variables -\> **Columns**
2.  Observations -\> **Rows**
3.  Values -\> **Cells**

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

If dataframes are tidy, it's easy to transform, visualize, model, and program them using tidyverse packages (a whole workflow).

![Tidyverse: an opinionated collection of R packages](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/0*mlPyX0NE0WQwEzpS.png)

-   Nevertheless, don't be **religious**.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations are essential (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)). These computations are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames (for more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)).

This is what tidy data looks like.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table1
```

**Additional tips**

There are so many different ways of looking at data in R. Can you discuss the pros and cons of each approach? Which one do you prefer and why?

-   `str(table1)`

-   `glimpse(table1)`: similar to `str()` cleaner output

-   `skim(table1)`: `str()` + `summary()` + more

-   The big picture

    -   Tidying data with **tidyr**
    -   Processing data with **dplyr**

These two packages don't do anything new but simplify most common tasks in data manipulation. Plus, they are fast, consistent, and more readable.

Practically, this approach is right because you will have consistency in data format across all the projects you're working on. Also, tidy data works well with key packages (e.g., `dplyr,` `ggplot2`) in R.

Computationally, this approach is useful for vectorized programming because "different variables from the same observation are always paired". Vectorized means a function applies to a vector that treats each element individually (=operations working in parallel).

## Visualizing (ggplot2)

-   The following material is adapted from Kieran Healy's excellent book (2019) on [data visualization](https://socviz.co/) and Hadley Wickham's equally excellent book on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/). For more theoretical discussions, I recommend you to read [The Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F0-387-28695-0) by Leland Wilkinson.

### The grammar of graphics

-   the grammar of graphics

    -   data
    -   aesthetic attributes (color, shape, size)
    -   geometric objects (points, lines, bars)
    -   stats (summary stats)
    -   scales (map values in the data space)
    -   coord (data coordinates)
    -   facet (facetting specifications)

No worries about new terms. We're going to learn them by actually plotting.

-   Workflow:

    1.  Tidy data (what data) : `ggplot(data = )`
    2.  Mapping (what relationships) : `aes(x = ,  y= )`
    3.  Geom (how) : `geom_()` 
    4.  Cooordinates and scales (how to see)
    5.  Labels and guides (how to guide) : `labs(),` `guides()`
    6.  Themes (how to theme)
    7.  Save files

### mapping and geom

-   `aes` (aesthetic mappings or aesthetics) tells which variables (x, y) in your data should be represented by which visual elements (color, shape, size) in the plot.

-   `geom_` tells the type of plot you are going to use

### basic aes (x , y)

```{r}
p <- ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)
) # ggplot or R in general takes positional arguments too. So, you don't need to name data, mapping each time you use ggplot2.

p

p + geom_point()

p + geom_point() + geom_smooth() # geom_smooth has calculated a smoothed line;
# the shaded area is the standard error for the line
```

### Univariate distribution

- Types of univariate plots (Nolan and Stoudt 2021: 72): 

    - Quantitative: rug plot, histogram, density curve, box-and-whisker plot, violin plot, normal quantile plot
    - Qualitative: bar plot, dot chart, line plot, pie chart

-   `geom_histogram()`: For the probability distribution of a continuous variable. Bins divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals (see [the Wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)).
-   `geom_density()`: Also for the probability distribution of a continuous variable. It calculates a [kernel density estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) of the underlying distribution.

#### Histogram

```{r}
data(midwest) # load midwest dataset

midwest
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) +
  geom_point() # not working.
```

```{r}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) +
  geom_histogram() # stat_bin argument picks up 30 bins (or "bucket") by default.

midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) # only 10 bins.

ggplot(
  data = subset(midwest, state %in% c("OH", "IN")),
  mapping = aes(x = percollege, fill = state)
) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.7, bins = 20) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

#### Density

```{r}
midwest %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area, fill = state, color = state)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

### Bivariate distributions

- Types of bivariate plots (Nolan and Stoudt 2021: 72): 

    - Both quantitative: scatter plot, smooth curve, contour plot, heat map
    - Both qualitative: side-by-side bar plots, mosaic plot, overlaid lines
    - Quantitative/Qualitative: overlaid density curves, side-by-side box-and-whisker plots, overlaid smooth curves, quantile-quantile plot

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, 
            aes(x = gdpPercap, 
                y = lifeExp))

# Scatter plot 
p + geom_point()
```

Smoothing helps to clarify the trend(s).

```{r}
# Adding a smoothed line 

p + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

p + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# rug plot
p + geom_point() +
  geom_rug()
```

If observations are too few: consider using scatter plots without a smoothed line. 

Discrete comparison 

```{r}
# Bar plot

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(avg_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(continent, avg_life_exp), y = avg_life_exp)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

Temporal trends

```{r}
# Line plot using a summary
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_life_exp)) +
  geom_line()

# individual comparison 
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, 
             col = country)) +
  geom_line()

# overall trend
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, 
             fill = country)) +
  geom_area()
```

#### Advanced aes (size, color)

-   There's also `fill` argument (mostly used in `geom_bar()`). Color `aes` affects the appearance of lines and points, fill is for the filled areas of bars, polygons, and in some cases, the interior of a smoother's standard error ribbon.

-   The property size/color/fill represents...

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    size = pop
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    size = pop,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
# try red instead of "red"
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    size = pop,
    color = "red"
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

Aesthetics also can be mapped per Geom.

```{r}
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + # alpha controls transparency
  geom_smooth(color = "red", se = FALSE, size = 2)

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + # alpha controls transparency
  geom_smooth(color = "red", se = FALSE, size = 2, method = "lm")
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  )

ggplot(
  data = gapminder,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

#### Coordinates and scales

```{r}

p + geom_point() +
  coord_flip() # coord_type
```

The data is heavily bunched up against the left side.

```{r}

p + geom_point() # without scaling

p + geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() # scales the axis of a plot to a log 10 basis

p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_log10()
```

#### Labels and guides

`scales` package has some useful premade formatting functions. You can either load scales or just grab the function you need from the library using `scales::`

```{r}

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  )
```

6.  Themes

```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_economist()
```

### ggsave

```{r eval = FALSE}
figure_example <- p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    x = "log GDP",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "A Gapminder Plot",
    subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
    caption = "Source: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_economist()

ggsave(figure_example, here("outputs", "figure_example.png"))
```
