# Introduction to Data Visualization 

* Instructor: [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)

This advanced course introduces students to data visualization. Data doesn't speak for itself, so you need to analyze it and make the findings accessible by presenting them with effective visualization. In this course, we first focus on why some data visualization work and others don't. Second, we learn how to visualize data in an efficient and reproducible way using data science tools and techniques. Third, we practice plotting raw data, descriptive, and model summaries using static, animated, and interactive plots. Finally, we explore other forms of data visualization such as networks and maps.
